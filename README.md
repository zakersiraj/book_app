# List of Books: Application written for my newly born daughter
My daughter is born two weeks ago. She already has a lot books. In
order to manage the books that she has properly, I decided to write
this application.
At this moment, this application only lists the books that she has.
However, eventually I'll update this application as follows:
1. Add Wish Book List
2. Delete and update the List of Books (both availble and wish Book  lists) 
using the Web instead of using the rails console
3. Create a link to Babies'RE US and Amazone Sites
4. Incorporate Validations
